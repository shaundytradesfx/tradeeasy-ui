# Exploratory Testing Guide - TradeEasy Frontend

## Overview
This guide outlines exploratory testing scenarios to uncover issues that automated tests might miss, focusing on user experience, edge cases, and real-world usage patterns.

## Testing Approach
- **Session-based Testing**: 90-minute focused sessions
- **Charter-based**: Each session has a specific mission
- **Risk-based**: Prioritize high-risk areas
- **User Journey**: Follow realistic user paths

## Testing Sessions

- [ ] Adding first asset to watchlist
- [ ] Creating first alert
- [ ] Understanding real-time updates

**Key Questions**:
- Is the purpose of the application clear?
